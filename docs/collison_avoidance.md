Collision avoidance is a crucial part of autonomous vehicle systems. It comprises various algorithms, sensors, and techniques to predict potential collisions and take appropriate actions to avoid them. If we consider vehicles moving along defined PathSegment instances like in your code, several methods can be used:
1. Distance Keeping: Use the distance between vehicles to ensure that they maintain a safe separation while moving along the path. If a vehicle gets too close to another, reduce its speed or even stop it to prevent collisions. The safe distance can be calculated based on vehicle speed, braking capability, road conditions, etc.
2. Speed Control: Limit the maximum speed of vehicles on a given path segment. This can help provide vehicles with enough time to detect and react to objects in their vicinity.
