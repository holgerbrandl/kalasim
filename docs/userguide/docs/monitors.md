# Monitors

Monitors are a built-in mechanism of `kalasim` to collect data from a simulation. Monitors collect metrics automatically for [resources](resource.md), [components](component.md), [states](state.md) and [collections](collections.md). On top of that the user can define her own monitors.

Monitors allow to capture  and visualize the dynamics of a simulation model. There are two types of monitors:

* **Level monitors** are useful to collect data about a variable that keeps its value over a certain length
  of time, such as the length of a queue or the color of a traffic light.
* **Value monitors** are useful to collect distributional statistics without a time-dimension. Examples, are the length of stay in a queue, or the number of processing steps of a part.

For both types, the time is always collected, along with the value.

Monitors support a wide range of statistical properties via `m.statistics()` including

* mean
* median
* percentiles
* min and max
* standard deviation
* histograms


For all these statistics, it is possible to exclude zero entries,
e.g. `m.statistics(statistics=true)` returns the mean, excluding zero entries.

Monitors can be disabled with `disable()` by setting the boolean flag ``.

```kotlin
m.disable()  // disable monitoring

m.reset()              // reenable statistics monitoring
m.reset(initialValue)   // reenable level monitoring
```

Continuation of a temporarily disabled monitor is currently not supported.

## Value Monitors

Non-level monitors collects values which do not reflect a level, e.g. the processing time of a part.

There are  2 implementations to support categorical and numerical attributes

* `org.kalasim.NumericStatisticMonitor`
* `org.kalasim.FrequencyMonitor`


Besides, it is possible to get all collected values as list with `m.statistics().values`.


Calling `m.reset()` will clear all collected values.

## Level Monitors

Level monitors tally levels along with the current (simulation) time. E.g. the number of parts a machine is working on.

There are  2 implementations to support categorical and numerical attributes

* `org.kalasim.CategoryTimeline`
* `org.kalasim.MetricTimeline`


Level monitors allow to query the value at a specific time
```kotlin
val nlm = MetricTimeline()
// ... collecting some data ...
nlm[4]  // will query the value at time 4

nlm[now] // will query the current value 
```

In addition to standard statistics, level monitors support the following statistics

* `duration`

For all statistics, it is possible to exclude zero entries, e.g. `m.statistics(excludeZeros=true).mean` returns the mean, excluding zero entries.


[//]: # (**{todo}** implement off tallying)
<!--When monitoring is disabled, an off value (see table above) will be tallied. All statistics will ignore the periods from this-->
<!--off to a non-off value. This also holds for the `xduration()` method, but NOT for xt() and tx(). Thus,-->
<!--the x-arrays of `xduration()` are not necessarily the same as the x-arrays in xt() and tx(). This is-->
<!--the reason why there's no x() or t() method. |n|-->
<!--It is easy to get just the x-array with `xduration()[0]` or `xt()[0]`.-->

<!--It is important that a user *never* tallies an off value! Instead use Monitor.monitor(False)-->

<!--With the monitor method, a level monitor can be enbled or disabled.-->

<!--Also, the current monitor status (enabled/disabled) can be retrieved.-->

Calling `m.reset()` will clear all tallied values and timestamps.

The statistics of a level monitor can be printed with `m.printStatistics()`.

## Histograms

The statistics of a monitor can be printed with `printStatistics()`.
E.g: `waitingLine.lengthOfStayMonitor.printStatistics()`:

```json
{
    "all": {
      "entries": 5,
      "ninety_pct_quantile": 4.142020545932034,
      "median": 1.836,
      "mean": 1.211,
      "ninetyfive_pct_quantile": 4.142020545932034,
      "standard_deviation": 1.836
    },
    "excl_zeros": {
      "entries": 2,
      "ninety_pct_quantile": 4.142020545932034,
      "median": 1.576,
      "mean": 3.027,
      "ninetyfive_pct_quantile": 4.142020545932034,
      "standard_deviation": 1.576
    }
}
```

And, a histogram can be printed with `printHistogram()`. E.g.
`waitingLine.lengthOfStayMonitor.printHistogram()`:

```
Histogram of: 'Available quantity of fuel_pump'
              bin | entries |  pct |                                         
[146.45, 151.81]  |       1 |  .33 | *************                           
[151.81, 157.16]  |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[157.16, 162.52]  |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[162.52, 167.87]  |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[167.87, 173.23]  |       1 |  .33 | *************                           
[173.23, 178.58]  |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[178.58, 183.94]  |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[183.94, 189.29]  |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[189.29, 194.65]  |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[194.65, 200.00]  |       1 |  .33 | *************    
```

If neither `binCount`, nor `lowerBound` nor `upperBound` are specified, the histogram will be autoscaled.

Histograms can be printed with their values, instead of bins. This is particularly useful for non
numeric tallied values, such as names::

```kotlin
val m = FrequencyMonitor<Car>()

m.addValue(AUDI)
m.addValue(AUDI)
m.addValue(VW)
repeat(4) { m. addValue(PORSCHE)}

m.printHistogram()
```

The output of this:

```
Summary of: 'FrequencyMonitor.2'
# Records: 7
# Levels: 3

Histogram of: 'FrequencyMonitor.2'
              bin | entries |  pct |                                         
AUDI              |       2 |  .29 | ***********                             
VW                |       1 |  .14 | ******                                  
PORSCHE           |       4 |  .57 | ***********************           
```


It is also possible to specify the values to be shown:

```
m.printHistogram(values = listOf(AUDI, TOYOTA)) 
```

This results in a further aggregated histogram view where non-selected values are agregated and listes values are forced in the display even if they were not observed.

```
Summary of: 'FrequencyMonitor.1'
# Records: 7
# Levels: 3

Histogram of: 'FrequencyMonitor.1'
              bin | entries |  pct |                                         
AUDI              |       2 |  .29 | ***********                             
TOYOTA            |       0 |  .00 |                                         
rest              |       5 |  .71 | *****************************
```

It is also possible to sort the histogram on the weight (or number of entries) of the value:

```
m.printHistogram(sortByWeight = true)
```

The output of this:

```
Summary of: 'FrequencyMonitor.1'
# Records: 7
# Levels: 3

Histogram of: 'FrequencyMonitor.1'
              bin | entries |  pct |                                         
PORSCHE           |       4 |  .57 | ***********************                 
AUDI              |       2 |  .29 | ***********                             
VW                |       1 |  .14 | ******
```

For numeric monitors it is possible to show values instead of ranges as bins
```kotlin
val nlm = MetricTimeline()

now += 2
nlm.addValue(2)

now += 2
nlm.addValue(6)
now += 4

nlm.printHistogram(valueBins = false)
nlm.printHistogram(valueBins = true)
```

which will result by default in

```
Histogram of: 'MetricTimeline.1'
              bin | entries |  pct |                                         
[.00, .60]        |     232 |  .23 | *********                               
[.60, 1.20]       |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[1.20, 1.80]      |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[1.80, 2.40]      |     233 |  .23 | *********                               
[2.40, 3.00]      |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[3.00, 3.60]      |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[3.60, 4.20]      |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[4.20, 4.80]      |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[4.80, 5.40]      |       0 |  .00 |                                         
[5.40, 6.00]      |     535 |  .54 | *********************                   

```
However, when valueBins is enabled the histogram becomes

```
Histogram of: 'MetricTimeline.1'
              bin | entries |  pct |                                         
0.0               |       2 |  .25 | **********                              
2.0               |       2 |  .25 | **********                              
6.0               |       4 |  .50 | ********************
```



##  Monitors Arithmetics

It is possible to merge the metric timeline monitors

```kotlin
val mtA = MetricTimeline()
val mtB = MetricTimeline()

// we can do all types of arithmetics
mtA + mtB
mtA - mtB
mtA / mtB
mtA * mtB

// or work out their average over time
listOf(mtA, mtB).mean()
```

It is also possible to merge the resulting statistics of multiple monitors

```kotlin
val flmA = CategoryTimeline(1)
val flmB = CategoryTimeline(2)

// ... run simulation 

val mergedStats: EnumeratedDistribution<Int> = listOf(flmA, flmB).mergeStats()
```

See [`MergeMonitorTests`](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kalasim/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/org/kalasim/test/MonitorTests.kt) for more examples regarding the other monitor types.

## Slicing of monitors

**Note**: Slicing of monitors as in [salabim](https://www.salabim.org/manual/Monitor.html#slicing-of-monitors) is  not yet supported. If needed please file a [ticket](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kalasim/issues).

Use-cases for slicing are

* to get statistics on a monitor with respect to a given time period, most likely a subrun
* to get statistics on a monitor with respect to a recurring time period, like hour 0-1, hour 0-2, etc.

##  Summarizing a monitor

`Monitor.statistics()`  returns a 'frozen' monitor that can be used to store the results not depending on the current environment. This is particularly useful for persisting monitor statistics for later analysis.

## Visualization

It is possible to render monitors with the following extension functions
```kotlin
NumericStatisticMonitor.display() 
MetricTimeline.display()
```

![](monitors_images/monitor.png)

In particular multiple outputs are supported here by the underlying `kravis` visualization windows, which allows forward backward navigation (via the arrow buttons). See `org.kalasim.examples.bank.resources.Bank3ClerksResources` for an example where multiple visualizing are combined to inspect the internal state of the simulation.


Note that, currently monitor visualization just works in retrospect, and it is not (yet) possible to view the progression while a simulation is still running.
