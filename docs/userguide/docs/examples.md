<!--# Examples-->

There's nothing more intriguing than a good example. To provide guidance we tried to categorize our examples by difficulty. Categorization is opinionated and just tries to pave an entry path into `kalasim` API.

Simple

* [Car](examples/car.md) - A single car, a driver, and red traffic light in the middle of the night. The thrilling landing page example but this time fully documented with an extensive code-walkthrough.  
* [Traffic](examples/traffic.md) - Car navigate through a simple traffic model with crossings and traffic-lights. Clearly, they need to refill, but there is just a limited number of slots as the gas station.
* [Bank Office with 1 clerk](examples/bank_office.md#simple-bank-office-1-clerk) - A classic queue, where customers arrive at a bank and need to be serviced

Moderate

* [Movie Theater](examples/movie_theater.md) - A big cinema, great movies. How long does it take before tickets are sold out?
* [Car Wash](examples/car_wash.md) - A car wash with limited throughput, and a continuous stream of new customers
* [Machine Parts](examples/machine_parts.md) - A small shop-floor with multi-part machines, where all parts must be functional to avoid tool downtime
* [Machine Shop](examples/machine_shop.md) - A day in a life of a busy maintenance engineer. Tools break and need to be repaired before they can continue operation
* [The Ferryman](examples/ferryman.md) - A wild river, one boat only, and a patient ferryman transporting batches of passengers across the body of water

Elaborate

* [ATM](examples/atm_queue.md) - The canonical queue model. Here, illustrated with a cash machine that needs to serve customers.
* [Gas Station](examples/gas_station.md) - A gas-station again, but this time the focus is on the station itself and how it struggls to get new petrol to serve hungry customers.
* [Bank Office](examples/bank_office.md#bank-office-with-resources) - A classical queue problem where customers need to be served. Here solved 4 times in different ways using different `kalasim` models.
* [Dining Philosophers](examples/dining_philosophers.md) -  Philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti and try to eat. It ain't easy...
* [Office Tower](examples/office_tower.md) - A busy office building, where workers need to get from floor to floor using a limited number of elevators.
