Letâ€™s start with a very simple model. The example demonstrates the main mode of operation, the core API and the component process model implemented in `kalasim`. We want to build a simulation where a single car is driving around for a some time before stopping in front of a red traffic light.

```kotlin
//{!api/Car.kts!}
```

<!--This example corresponds to the `Cars` `salabim` example https://www.salabim.org/manual/Modeling.html-->

For each (active) component we (can) define a type such as:

```kotlin
class Car : Component()
```

The class inherits from `org.kalasim.Component`.

Our car depends on a [state](../state.md) `TrafficLight` and [resource](../resource.md) `Driver` for operation. To implement that, we first declare these dependencies with `dependency{}` in the main body of the simulation, and secondly [inject](../basics.md#dependency-injection) them into our car with `get<T>`. Note, we could also directly inject states and resources with `dependency {State("red")}` without sub-classing.

Although it is possible to define other processes within a class,
the standard way is to define a generator function called `process` in the class.
A generator is a function that returns `Sequence<Component>`. Within these process definitions we use [`suspend`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/basics.html#your-first-coroutine)able interaction function calls as a [signal](../basics.md#dependency-injection) to give control to the centralized [event loop](../basics.md#event-queue).

In this example,

```kotlin
hold(1.hour)
```

suspends execution control and *comes back* after 1 hour (of simulated time). Apart from [`hold`](../component.md#hold), `kalasim` supports a rich vocabulary of interaction methods including [`passivate`](../component.md#passivate), [`request`](../component.md#request), [`wait`](../component.md#wait) and [`component`](../component.md#standby).


The main body of every `kalasim` model usually starts with:
```
createSimulation{
...
}
```
Here, we enable event logging of state changes to see the status of simulation on the console. After declaring our dependencies, we instantiate a single car with `Car()`. It automatically is assigned the name *Car.0*.

As there is a generator function called `process` in `Car`, this process description will be activated (by default at time `now`, which is `0` by default at the beginning of a simulation). It is possible to start a process later, but this is by far the most common way to start a process.

With

```kotlin
run(5.minutes)
```

we start the simulation and get back control after 5 simulated minutes. A component called *main* is defined under the hood to get access to the main process.

When we run this program, we get the following output (displayed as table for convenience):

```

5.00   main     main

```

There are plenty of other more advanced (that is more **fun**!) examples listed in [examples](../examples.md) chapter.
