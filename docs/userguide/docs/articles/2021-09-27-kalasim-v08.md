[comment]: <> (## Kalasim v0.8)

After some more months of continued refinements, extensions and refactorings, and - for sure - a sightly number of new simulations across different domains and industries, we present with great pleasure the next milestone **v0.8** release of **kalasim**!

`kalasim` v0.8 has matured considerable across the entire API. From a small experimental API it has grown into a battle-tested real-time scalable open-architecture simulation engine, designed not just for engineers, but for business process analysts and industrial engineers who need to go beyond the limitations of existing simulation tools to model and optimize their business-critical use-cases. 
.


## New Features

With this milestone release, we have further stabilized its core API, improved its performance while adding new features all over the place.

Major enhancements in this release are

* Support for `kotlin.time.Duration` across the entire API. Processes can be expressed much more naturally using time-units when expressing durations:

```kotlin


val sim = createSimulation {
    object : Component() {
        override fun process() = sequence {
            hold(3.days)
            // some action
            hold(2.minutes)
        }
    }
}

sim.run(3.years)
```


* Added new options to model [resource honor policies](resource.md#request-honor-policies) to allow for more configurable request queue consumption
```kotlin
val r  = Resource(honorPolicy = RequestHonorPolicy.StrictFCFS)
```
* Added [Timeline Arithmetics](monitors.md#monitors-arithmetics). It is now possible to perform stream arithmetics on timeline attributes
* We have reworked and simplified [depletable resources](resource.md#depletable-resources). This enables a wide range of new usecases. See [lunar mining](../animation/lunar_mining.md) for a great example. As part of this feature, we have introduced different [request modes](resource.md#capacity-limit-modes) to model resources requests that exceed resource capacity.
    ```kotlin
    val tank  = DepletableResource(capacity=100, initialLevel=60)
    
    put(gasSupply, 50, capacityLimitMode = CapacityLimitMode.CAP)
    ```
* A new [animation submodule](../animation.md) to visualize process simulations was added. To keep the core API minimalistic, a new dependency adds all required dependencies from [openrendr](https://openrndr.org/). This additional dependency also provides complimentary utilities such as `AnimationComponent` to streamline rendering. To demonstrate the capabilities, we have worked out several examples such as the [moon base](../animation/lunar_mining.md) and [the office tower](../examples/office_tower.md).


Other notable enhancements in this release are a streamlined [predicate consumption](state.md#predicate-testing) in `wait()`, more supported [statistical distributions](basics.md#continuous-distributions), improved [bottleneck analysis](../resource.md) using resource request-ids and `RequestScopeContext` in honor block. First community PRs were merged, in particular 
[#35](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kalasim/pull/35) which improved the support for asynchronous event consumption.

## Example & Documentation Improvements

Several new examples were added as part of this release. First, we explored resource [mining on the moon](../animation/lunar_mining.md), where we don't just demonstrate how to model a complex mining and logistics operation, but also showcase how to animate this process. In [the office tower](../examples/office_tower.md) we explore capacity planning via an interactive UI to size elevators in a busy office building.

## Acknowledgments

Different individuals and organizations made this milestone release possible. Most importantly, we'd like to thank [SYSTEMA GmbH](https://www.systema.com/) for supporting the project.     

## Next steps

While improving `kalasim`, we have dropped some roadmap items sketched out [earlier](2021-11-27-kalasim-v07.md#next-steps).

* [Environment snapshotting & branching](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kalasim/issues/19): While we still believe that this would be highly beneficial, the feature is currently blocked by issues with serialization of kotlin objects (in particular [coroutines](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kalasim/issues/19))
* We have evaluated but eventually dropped the idea of [algebraic composability](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kalasim/issues/25) of simulation environments. Mainly because instances of `org.kalasim.Environment` can be configured to be incompatible on various levels which can't be resolved with a simple `+`

Next on our roadmap are various [open tickets](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kalasim/issues) as well as the following meta-tasks 

* The next release is likely to [enforce a tick-duration](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kalasim/issues/49) (seconds, hours, etc.) for any simulation. Along with that, to improve the type-safety and readability of process definitions, we will start replacing all - essentially untyped - tick-time duration method arguments with `kotlin.time.Duration` equivalents.
* Better [examples](https://www.kalasim.org/examples/) & better teaching materials: We will continue to release more complex  simulations with thousands of simulation entities (in particular finishing the [emergency room](https://www.kalasim.org/examples/emergency_room/)), along with protocols on how to analyze and optimize dynamics in such systems.
* Improved [kotlin-jupyter](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter) integration to bring more control and introspection functions into the browser



Please note, that the `kalasim` APIs will be subject to breaking changes until a first major release.
