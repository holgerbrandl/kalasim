## Github Actions

revert remote tags that prevent pushing because of
> error: dst refspec refs/heads/master matches more than one

```bash
git push origin :refs/tags/refs/heads/master
```

## Coroutine Serialization

Main Thread https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/issues/76

Older reference https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/kotlin-serialization/2063/14
> Serialization of coroutines is a larger problem that is not directly related to an actual serialization format. Current implementation of coroutines is serializable with both Java Serialization (they implement java.io.Serializable) as well as with 3rd party Java libraries (Iâ€™ve tested it with Kryo and it works).

## Priority Queue

https://newbedev.com/how-to-iterate-over-a-priorityqueue

> It's not a sorted array, so that you can just go from one element to the one with the lesser priority.
> 
> Peeking (read the top element heap in the heap) is constant time O(1) because it looks at the smallest element.
> 
> To get the second next one you must dequeue the smallest top element, that's how it works.
> Dequeing (re-heapify = O(log n) time) isn't just a matter of taking that element out, the underlying structure rearranges itself in order to bring the element with the least priority first.
        

Workaround https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8129122/how-to-iterate-over-a-priorityqueue --> sort it outside using the queue comparator
```kotlin
Arrays.sort(theActualArray, pq.comparer())
Arrays.sort(pq.toArray())
```

## Structured logging


> Structured logging is the practice of implementing a consistent, predetermined message format for application logs that allows them to be treated as data sets rather than text.
